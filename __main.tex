\begin{abstract} 
The uncanny valley effect proposed by Masahiro Mori \cite{original_masahiro} states that as the appearance of an entity is approaching, but failing to attain, a lifelike appearance, the empathy of a person towards the entity is abruptly shifting from affinity to revulsion. By seeking to explain the interplay between affinity and the appearance of human-like entities, the implications of the uncanny valley profoundly impact the design choices of such human-like figures. 
Robot recruitment is a recent innovation which refers to the automation of the recruiting process, in which candidates are evaluated and selected using algorithms and artificial \cite{robot_recruiting_scholar}. These robot recruiters can be visualised with human-like virtual characters to make them more appealing to the applicants. With the help of an online survey based on rating potential robot recruiters with varying human-likeness, this thesis explores how applicantsâ€™ feelings toward different designs of robot recruiters vary and, if  very but not perfectly human-like, robot recruiters fall into the uncanny valley. The results of this survey showed that the uncanny valley does occur in robot recruiters, but the robot recruiters chosen in this study were able to escape the uncanny valley and, therefore, an almost perfect human likeness correlated with high likeability. However, no robot recruiter was rated better than the human. In addition, especially reasonably recognisable abnormal design elements or atypical features have led to robot recruiters being identified as eerie and strange. However, additional research is needed to explore the design recommendations and the uncanny valley in robot recruiters further.
